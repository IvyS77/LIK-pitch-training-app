## 🚀 Overview
**LIK Pitch Trainer** is designed for musicians and students to sharpen their absolute and relative pitch. By combining a low-latency **Tone.js** audio engine with a real-time **Firebase** backend, the app provides a seamless training experience with haptic feedback and progress tracking.

## ✨ Key Features
* **🎹 Real-time Pitch Generation**: Powered by `Tone.js` with a Singleton pattern for high-performance audio on mobile.
* **🌓 Seamless Dark Mode**: Dynamic theming using `useColorScheme` for a consistent UI/UX.
* **☁️ Cloud Integration**: Full Firebase suite integration (Auth, Firestore, and Storage).
* **📳 Haptic Feedback**: Tactile responses via `expo-haptics` for correct/incorrect answers.
* **📸 Profile Customization**: Native image picking and high-reliability Blob uploading via custom `XMLHttpRequest` buffers.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Debugging
This project showcases advanced solutions for common React Native hurdles:
* **Native Audio Bypass**: Implemented `expo-av` audio modes to ensure playback during iOS silent mode.
* **Blob Handling**: Solved `Network request failed` errors by refactoring standard `fetch` into manual `XMLHttpRequest` for local file-to-blob conversion.
* **State Persistence**: Custom Hooks (`use-auth`) for managing Firebase authentication states.
